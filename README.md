# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
A professional created README generator for your ease-of-use! It's very simple to get started, as it only requires you to use a Git terminal like VS Code. <br>
Simply just use node index.js command line to initiate the code, and you will be prompt with a series of questions to build your read me file. <br>
<br>
Those questions will include project title, github username, email address, description, installation instructions, main usage, license, contribution guidelines, and testing instructions. <br>
After you are done with your questions, it will generate the read me in a easy-to-read format within a specific folder path(./assets/utils/). <br>
<br>
Come on and give it a try today! What are you waiting for? <br>
